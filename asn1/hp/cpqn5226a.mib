--  This MIB is designed for the Agent for the Compaq 5226A Switch
--  of products. 
--
--  Management Software will refer to any SNMP based Network Management 
--  Application.
--
--  Note that the term DURABLE implies that the value for the object is
--  stored in the NVRAM of the unit and will be retained across power
--  cycles.
