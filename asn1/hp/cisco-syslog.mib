-- This MIB provides a means to gather syslog messages generated
-- by the Cisco IOS

-- Terminology:
-- Various textual messages are generated by the Cisco IOS.  The IOS
-- can be configured such that these messages are sent to a "syslog"
-- server.  With this MIB these same messages can also be received via
-- the SNMP.  These messages are hereupon referred to as "syslog
-- messages" in this document. Note: Messages generated as a result 
-- of entering CLI debug commands are not made available via the SNMP
-- at this time.
-- 
-- All IOS syslog messages have the following attributes:
--	timestamp (optional), facility name (where the message came
--	from), severity, message name, message text
--
-- The following example is often seen:
--	%SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console ...
-- where facility=SYS, severity=5, message name=CONFIG_I
