========================== SNMP 6.1 =============================

The CL-NET-SNMP project is pleased to announce the release of 6.1. This
is a major patch release which contains numerous enhancements from the
last 6.0.x releases.

CL-NET-SNMP is a free, high-level implementation of the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP), which is common used for Unix/Linux system
administration and network management. CL-NET-SNMP provides a fast ASN.1
BER encode/decode engine; a MIB to Common Lisp compiler; a dynamic MIB
loader for runtime loading of MIB objects; a SNMP server which could run
inside any supported Common Lisp platform for montoring your Lisp
server-side applications; and an group of handful interface function for
doing every SNMP operations. On LispWorks, CL-NET-SNMP has a GUI based
"MIB Browser".  CL-NET-SNMP supports SNMPv3 by help of the IRONCLAD
crypto library, and do TCP/UDP networking based on USOCKET 0.5.x.
CL-NET-SNMP is maintained by Chun Tian (binghe), a Chinese Common Lisp
programmer.

News in this release:

  * New features:
    - Add support for SNMP/TCP (client-side only), by using the optional
      keyword argument (:PROTOCOL :TCP) in SNMP:OPEN-SESSION or
      SNMP:WITH-OPEN-SESSION.

    - Add support for Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL/RMCL), TCP only.

  * Other changes:
    - Re-depend on trivial-gray-streams for MCL and SCL support.

information, guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.

I hope you can enjoy using this release of CL-NET-SNMP!
