	STATUS		current
	DESCRIPTION
		"Represents the different types of memory pools that
		may be present in a managed device.  Memory pools can
		be roughly categorized into two groups, predefined
		pools and dynamic pools.  The following pool types
		are currently predefined:
			1:  processor memory
			2:  i/o memory
			3:  pci memory
			4:  fast memory
			5:  multibus memory

		Dynamic pools will have a pool type value greater than
		any of the predefined types listed above.

		Note that only the processor pool is required to be
		supported by all devices.  Support for other pool types
		is dependent on the device being managed."
