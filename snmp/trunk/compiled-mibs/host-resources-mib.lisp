   "This MIB is for use in managing host systems. The term
       `host' is construed to mean any computer that communicates
       with other similar computers attached to the internet and
       that is directly used by one or more human beings. Although
       this MIB does not necessarily apply to devices whose primary
       function is communications services (e.g., terminal servers,
       routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such relevance is
       not explicitly precluded.  This MIB instruments attributes
       common to all internet hosts including, for example, both
       personal computers and systems that run variants of Unix."))

        products from a particular manufacturer are registered

        addition, all versions of a product should be
        registered under a subtree distinct to that product.

        whose productID is unknown to the management station.

        purposes or for automatically detecting
        incompatibilities or version mismatches between
        various hardware and software components on a system.

   "The (conceptual) table of logical storage areas on

        An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each
        logical area of storage that is allocated and has
        fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage
        represented in an entity is the amount actually usable
        by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to
        formatting or file system reference information.

        These entries are associated with logical storage
        areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than
        physical storage entities which are typically seen by
        an operating system.  Storage such as tapes and
        floppies without file systems on them are typically
        not allocated in chunks by the operating system to
        requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't
        appear in this table.  Examples of valid storage for
        this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram
        (for some architectures this is further segmented into
        regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing
        store for virtual memory (`swap space').

        This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for
        `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of
        failures.  In addition, it can be a useful performance
        monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer
