              each logical area of storage that is allocated and
              has fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage
              represented in an entity is the amount actually
              usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss
              due to formatting or file system reference
              information.

              These entries are associated with logical storage
              areas, as might be seen by an application, rather
              than physical storage entities which are typically

              and floppies without file systems on them are
              typically not allocated in chunks by the operating
              system to requesting applications, and therefore
              shouldn't appear in this table.  Examples of valid

              memory (`swap space').

              failures.  In addition, it can be a useful
