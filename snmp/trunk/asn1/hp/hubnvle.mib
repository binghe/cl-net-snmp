                      "This octet string represents the current
                      configuration of groups, encoded as a bit string.
                      Each group is represented by a single bit. When
                      the value of a bit=1, it indicates that the group
                      represented by that bit is present in the
                      repeater; when zero, the group is not present.

                      match the IETF conventions, and will be modified
                      appropriately.

                      The number of octets in the string is
                      rptrBasGroupCapacity divided by 8, rounded up to
                      the next whole number of octets.  For example, if
                      rptrBasGroupCapacity is 12, the octet string
                      returned by the agent will be of length two.

                      The first octet will encode the configuration of
                      groups 1-8, where group one is represented by the
                      least significant bit of the octet.  The second
                      octet will likewise encode groups 9-16.  In
                      general, octet i encodes groups (8i-7) through
                      (8i), where (8i-7) is represented by the least

                      reset is exerted shall remain disabled when normal

                      The admin state takes precedence over auto-

                      becomes disabled, its current auto-partition state
                      is frozen until the port is next enabled. When the

                      Note: shortEvents may indicate an externally
