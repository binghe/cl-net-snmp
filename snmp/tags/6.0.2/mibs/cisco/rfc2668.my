                      support setting the value of this object to some
                      of the enumerated values.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in
                      a state other than one of the states 2 through
                      6.

                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.

                      A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                      functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                      attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                      its specification.

                      A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                      idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                      if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                      link type MAUs.  The state of
                      rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                      A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                      condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                      as though it were powered down or not connected.
                      The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                      rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
                      when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                      state will remove power from the AUI.

                      Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                      resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                      power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                      second would.  The agent is not required to
                      return the value reset (6).

                      Setting this variable to the value
                      operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                      causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                      except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                      to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the

          STATUS      current
          DESCRIPTION "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                      10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                      the link test fail state/low light function.
                      For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                      this indicates whether or not loopback is
                      detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                      attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                      AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the
                      mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.

                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                      reset, the value of this attribute will be
                      unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                      these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                      transmission during which no collision is
                      detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                      returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                      has been no collision during the transmission
                      then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                      this attribute will only change during
                      non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                      10BASE-FP MAUs.

                      For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                      match the states within the respective link
                      integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                      24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                      MAU which implements management of
                      auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                      indication to remote fault.

                      The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                      light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                      notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                      or no loopback.

                      The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                      has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                      This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                      End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                      faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                      The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                      and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                      remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                      is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                      The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                      invalid signal has been received from the other
                      end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                      to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                      Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                      is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                      (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                      maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                      zero in the link status bit (reference section
                      22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                      notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                      takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                      Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                      Auto-Negotiation will map the received Remote
                      Fault (RF1 and RF2) bit values for Offline to
                      offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and
                      Auto-Negotiation Error to autoNegError(11)."

                      support setting the value of this object to some
                      of the enumerated values.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in
                      a state other than one of the states 2 through
                      6.

                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.

                      A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                      functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                      attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                      its specification.

                      A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                      idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                      if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                      link type MAUs.  The state of
                      ifMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                      A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                      condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                      as though it were powered down or not connected.
                      The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                      ifMauJabberState and ifMauMediaAvailable objects
                      when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                      state will remove power from the AUI.

                      Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                      resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                      power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                      second would.  The agent is not required to
                      return the value reset (6).

                      Setting this variable to the value
                      operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                      causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                      except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                      to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the

          DESCRIPTION "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                      10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                      the link test fail state/low light function.
                      For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                      this indicates whether or not loopback is
                      detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                      attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                      AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the
                      mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.

                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                      reset, the value of this attribute will be
                      unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                      these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                      transmission during which no collision is
                      detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                      returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                      has been no collision during the transmission
                      then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                      this attribute will only change during
                      non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                      10BASE-FP MAUs.

                      For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                      match the states within the respective link
                      integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                      24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                      MAU which implements management of
                      auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                      indication to remote fault.

                      The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                      light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                      notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                      or no loopback.

                      The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                      has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                      This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                      End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                      faults from a system running auto-negotiation.

                      The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                      and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                      remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                      is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                      The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                      invalid signal has been received from the other
                      end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                      to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                      Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                      is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                      (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                      maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                      zero in the link status bit (reference section
                      22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                      notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                      takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                      Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                      Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and

                      this MAU, 2 raised to the power noted below is
                      added to the sum. For example, a MAU which has
                      the capability to be only 10BASE-T would have a
                      value of 512 (2**9).  In contrast, a MAU which
                      supports both 10Base-T (full duplex) and

                      administrative baseband MAU type, to be used in
                      conjunction with the operational MAU type
                      denoted by ifMauType.

                      The set of possible values for this object is
                      the same as the set defined for the ifMauType
                      object.

                      This object represents the
                      administratively-configured type of the MAU.  If
                      auto-negotiation is not enabled or is not
                      implemented for this MAU, the value of this
                      object determines the operational type of the
                      MAU.  In this case, a set to this object will
                      force the MAU into the specified operating mode.

                      If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled
                      for this MAU, the operational type of the MAU
                      is determined by auto-negotiation, and the value
                      of this object denotes the type to which the MAU
                      will automatically revert if/when
                      auto-negotiation is later disabled.

                      NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  It may be necessary to
                      provide for underlying hardware implementations
                      which do not follow the exact behavior specified
                      above.  In particular, when
                      ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled
                      to disabled, the agent implementation MUST
                      ensure that the operational type of the MAU (as
                      reported by ifMauType) correctly transitions to
                      the value specified by this object, rather than
                      continuing to operate at the value earlier

                      A value that uniquely identifies the set of
                      capabilities of the local auto-negotiation
                      entity.  The value is a sum which initially
                      takes the value zero.  Then, for each capability
                      of this interface, 2 raised to the power noted

                      only 100Base-TX half duplex would have a value
                      of 32768 (2**15).  In contrast, an interface
                      which supports both 100Base-TX half duplex and
                      and 100Base-TX full duplex would have a value of
