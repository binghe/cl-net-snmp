2008-9-8: cl-net-snmp 5.0

Hi, Lispers

After one and a half year since I started this project (0.01 on May
2007, 1.2 on Oct 2007, 3.0 on July 21), I'm glad to
release cl-net-snmp 5.0 today, the pure-lisp implementation of Simple
Network Management Protocol (RFC 2570).

This project is part of my big plan: write a new system administration
platform (like HP OpenView) completely in Common Lisp.

New feature in 5.0:

 * Portable SNMP Server (snmp-server 2.0).
 * Auto-learn UDP timeout and retransmit support based on
   algorithms from TCP (usocket-udp 2.1).
 * Many bugfix include SNMPv3 support and thread-safe.
 * Seprate ASDF files: snmp.asd, snmp-server.asd, snmp-test.asd

SourceForge Project Home:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/cl-net-snmp

Project Dependency:

 * ironclad
 * usocket (0.4.x or trunk, current release (0.3.x) cannot use)
 * trivial-gray-streams
 * ieee-floats
 * portable-threads (from GBBopen project)

Current Supported Platforms:

 * LispWorks (include win32)
 * CMUCL
 * SBCL
 * Clozure CL (64-bit)
 * Allegro CL

Features:

 * Full SNMP protocol support (SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, SNMPv3)
 * Support MIB and ASN.1 object id names
 * Fast BER encode/decode based on CLOS
 * UDP retransmit support
 * Simple SNMP Server
 * [LispWorks] GUI MIB Browser

Documents:

 Still in progess. At current, you can see sample usage from test directory.
 If any user still get confused, feel free to ask me through email.

Download:

You can use ASDF-INSTALL to install cl-net-snmp 5.0, or download from
Sourceforge.net: (newest version in each sub-project except onlisp-cn)

 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=209101

I'm glad to hear at least one corpration use my SNMP package for monitoring
remote UNIX servers in their lisp product. I hope more lispers use my software
and report any bug or suggestion back to me.

Chun Tian (binghe)
