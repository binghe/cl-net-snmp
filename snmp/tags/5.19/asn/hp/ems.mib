					A Normal Event occurs when the value of the resource is in

					Monitoring requests configured for initial or return 
					notification may generate this event.  Also, the initial
					notification for a Change event is 'normal'.   
					
					The data passed with the event:
					
					  1)  The name of the resource being monitored.
					
					  2)  The request id, a unique identifier for the 
					      monitoring request.  This value should be used when 
					      using resdata to retrieve additional information
					      about the event.
					
					  3)  The operator used by EMS to determine when event 
					      notifications should be sent.  Possible values 
					      include:  poll, change, >, >=, <, <=, = and !=.

					      enumerated, integer, and float.
					 
					  5)  The resource value, which is the current value of the 
					      resource being monitored.  It is converted based on 
					      the resource type.
					
					  6)  The threshold type (usually the same as the resource
					      type) defines the type of value configured for the
					      threshold.  Possible values include: string, 
					      integer, and float.
					
					  7)  The threshold value configured for the resource being 
					      monitored.
					
					  8)  The user data flag, which indicates whether or not 
					      user data are available.  User data are comments 
					      provided by the user when the request was configured.
					      User data can be retrieved on the source node by 
					      running:
					        /opt/resmon/bin/resdata -r <resource name> \
					        -R <request id> -u 
					
					  9)  The monitor data flag, which indicates whether or not

					        /opt/resmon/bin/resdata -r <resource name> \
					        -R <request id> [-n <notify id>] -m 
						  
					 10)  The notification trigger indicates if the resource 
					      condition is normal or not.  For an EMSNormalEvent 
					      trap, the notification trigger is normal.
					
					 11)  The event type indicates the type of notification 
					      being sent.  The different types are:  
					        Poll    - for notification at every interval
					        Change  - for notification when the value changes

					 12)  The notify id, a unique identifier for a specific
