        DESCRIPTION             
                "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
                devices operating as Central controllers, that
                terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
                tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

                Information provided by this MIB is used to study
                the quality of service in the voice and video traffic
                on the WLAN.

                The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
                can be depicted as follows:

                The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
                the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
                the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

                LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
                controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
                that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
                The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
                wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
                the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                                   GLOSSARY

                Access Point ( AP )

                An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
                control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
                and provides access to the distribution services via
                the wireless medium for associated clients.  

                LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
                LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
                it is logically connected.

                Gratuitous Probe Response (GPR)

                The Gratuitous Probe Response feature aids in conserving
                battery power of WLAN-enabled cell phones by providing
                a high rate packet on the order of tens of milliseconds
                such that these kind of phones can wake up and wait at
                predefined intervals, to reduce battery power.  The 
                GPR packet is transmitted from the AP at a predefined
                time interval.
                 

                Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP )

                This is a generic protocol that defines the 
                communication between the Access Points and the
                Central Controller. 

                Mobile Node ( MN )

                A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
                network associated with an access point. Mobile Node 
                and client are used interchangeably. 

                TU

                A measurement of time in units of 1024 microseconds.

                User Priority ( UP )

                Specifies a the priority rules in QOS for handling user 
                priority.

                EDCA
                
                As defined in 802.11e standard, Enhanced distributed
                channel access(EDCA) parameter set element is used 
                by the AP to establish policy, to change policy when
                accepting new clients, or to adapt to changes in 
                offered load.

        DESCRIPTION
                "This object represents last VOIP failue reason code
         of this voice client.
         These reason codes are traken from SIP standards.

         unknown               - Unknown error

         normalFailure         - Call failed for insufficient bandwidth  
         
         roamFailure           - SIP call failed during roaming
         
         maxLimitExceeded      - Maximum SIP call permissible limit was exceeded.

         badRequest            - The request could not be understood 
         due to malformed syntax.

         unathorized           - The request requires user authentication.

         paymentRequired       - Reserved for future.

         forbidden             - The server understood the request, 
         but is refusing to fulfill it.

         notFound              - The server has definitive information
         that the user does not exist at the domain specified in the 
         Request-URI.

         methodNotallowed      - The method specified in the 
         Request-Line is understood, but not allowed for the address 
         identified by the Request-URI.

         notAcceptable         - The resource identified by the request 
         is only capable of generating response entities that have 
         content characteristics not acceptable according to the Accept
         header field sent in the request.

         proxyAuthenticationRequired - This code is similar to 401 
         (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client MUST first 
         authenticate itself with the proxy.  

         requestTimeout        - The server could not produce a 
         response within a suitable amount of time, for example, 
         if it could not determine the location of the user in time.

         conflict              - This is used to indicate that the 
         request could not be completed due to a conflict with the 
         current state of the resource.

         gone                  - The requested resource is no longer 
         available at the server and no forwarding address is known.

         lengthRequired        -  The server is refusing to process a 
         request because the request entity-body is larger than the 
         server is willing or able to process.

         requestEntityTooLarge - The server is refusing to process a 
         request because the request entity-body is larger than the 
         server is willing or able to process.

         requestURITooLarge    - The server is refusing to service the
         request because the Request-URI is longer than the server is 
         willing to interpret.

         unsupportedMediaType - The server is refusing to service the 
         request because the message body of the request is in a format 
         not supported by the server for the requested method.

         badExtension          - The server did not understand the 
         protocol extension specified in a Proxy-Require  or Require 
         header field.

         temporarilyNotAvailable - The callee's end system was contacted 
         successfully but the callee is currently unavailable.

         callLegDoesNotExist   - This status indicates that the UAS 
         received a request that does not match any existing dialog 
         or transaction.

         loopDetected          - The server has detected a loop.

         tooManyHops           - The server received a request that 
         contains a Max-Forwards header field with the value zero.

         addressIncomplete     - The server received a request with a 
         Request-URI that was incomplete.

         ambiguous             - The Request-URI was ambiguous.

         busy                  - The callee's end system was contacted 
         successfully, but the callee is currently not willing or able 
         to take additional calls at this end system. 

         internalServerError   - The server encountered an unexpected 
         condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

         notImplemented        - The server does not support the 
         functionality required to fulfill the request. 

         badGateway            - The server, while acting as a gateway 
         or proxy, received an invalid response from the downstream 
         server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.

         serviceUnavailable    - The server is temporarily unable to 
         process the request due to a temporary overloading or 
         maintenance of the server.

         serverTimeout         - The server did not receive a timely 
         response from an external server it accessed in attempting to 
         process the request.

         versionNotSupported    - The server does not support, or 
         refuses to support, the SIP protocol version that was used 
         in the request. 

         busyEverywhere        - The callee's end system was contacted 
         successfully but the callee is busy and does not wish to take 
         the call at this time. 

         decline               - The callee's machine was successfully 
         contacted but the user explicitly does not wish to or cannot 
         participate.

         doesNotExistAnywhere  - The server has authoritative 
         information that the user indicated in the Request-URI 
         does not exist anywhere.

         sessionNotAcceptable         - The user's agent was contacted 
         successfully but some aspects of the session description 
         such as the requested media, bandwidth, or addressing 
         style were not acceptable.
